      "source": "It's clear from the graph that ***q*** is a *linear* function that describes a slope in which distance increases at a constant rate over time. In other words, the cyclist is travelling at a constant speed.\n\nBut what speed?\n\nSpeed, or more technically, velocity is a measure of change - it measures how the distance travelled changes over time (which is why we typically express it as a unit of distance per a unit of time, like *miles-per-hour* or *meters-per-second*). So we're looking for a way to measure the change in the line created by the function.\n\nThe change in values along the line define its *slope*, which we know from a previous lesson is represented like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}m = \\frac{\\Delta{y}}{\\Delta{x}} \\end{equation}\n\nWe can calculate the slope of our function like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}m = \\frac{q(x)_{2} - q(x)_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}} \\end{equation}\n\nSo we just need two ordered pairs of ***x*** and ***q(x)*** values from our line to apply this equation.\n\n- After 1 second, ***x*** is 1 and ***q***(1) = **3**.\n- After 10 seconds, ***x*** is 10 and ***q***(10) = 21.\n\nSo we can meassure the rate of change like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}m = \\frac{21 - 3}{10 - 1} \\end{equation}\n\nThis is the same as:\n\n\\begin{equation}m = \\frac{18}{9} \\end{equation}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\begin{equation}m = \\frac{2}{1} \\end{equation}\n\nSo our rate of change is <sup>2</sup>/<sub>1</sub> or put another way, the cyclist is travelling at 2 meters-per-second."

It's actually a quadratic function, and the line from 0 seconds to 10 seconds shows an exponential increase; in other words, the cyclist is *accelerating*.\n\nTechnically, acceleration itself is a measure of change in velocity over time; and velocity, as we've already discussed, is a measure of change in distance over time. So measuring accelleration is pretty complex, and requires *differential calculus*, which we're going to cover shortly. In fact, even just measuring the velocity at a single point in time requires differential calculus; but we can use algebraic methods to calculate an *average* rate of velocity for a given period shown in the graph.\n\nFirst, we need to define a *secant* line that joins two points in our exponential arc to create a straight slope. For example, a secant line for the entire 10 second time span would join the following two points:\n\n- 0, ***r***(0)\n- 10, ***r***(10)\n\nRun the following Python code to visualize this line:"
