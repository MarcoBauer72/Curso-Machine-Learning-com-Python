The slope flattens out to 0, forming a \"saddle\" before the it starts increasing.\n\nWhat we can learn from this is that interesting things seem to happen to the function when the derivative is 0. We call points where the derivative crosses 0 *critical points*, because they indicate that the function is changing direction. When a function changes direction from positive to negative, it forms a peak (or a *local maximum*), when the function changes direction from negative to positive it forms a trough (or *local minimum*), and when it maintains the same overall direction but changes the concavity of the slope it creates an *inflexion point*."

      "source": "## Finding Minima and Maxima\nA common use of calculus is to find minimum and maximum points in a function. For example, we might want to find out how many seconds it took for the kicked football to reach its maximum height, or how long it took for our fertilizer to be effective in reversing the decline of flower growth.\n\nWe've seen that when a function changes direction to create a maximum peak or a minimum trough, the derivative of the function is 0, so a step towards finding these extreme points might be to simply find all of the points in the function where the derivative is 0. For example, here's our function for the kicked football:\n\n\\begin{equation}k(x) = -10x^{2} + 100x + 3 \\end{equation}\n\nFrom this, we've calculated the function for the derivative as:\n\n\\begin{equation}k'(x) = -20x + 100 \\end{equation}\n\nWe can then solve the derivative equation for an f'(x) value of 0:\n\n\\begin{equation}-20x + 100 = 0 \\end{equation}\n\nWe can remove the constant by subtracting 100 to both sides:\n\n\\begin{equation}-20x = -100 \\end{equation}\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gets rid of the negative values (this isn't strictly necessary, but makes the equation a little less confusing)\n\n\\begin{equation}20x = 100 \\end{equation}\n\nSo:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = 5 \\end{equation}\n\nSo we know that the derivative will be 0 when *x* is 5, but is this a minimum, a maximum, or neither? It could just be an inflexion point, or the entire function could be a constant value with a slope of 0) Without looking at the graph, it's difficult to tell.\n\n## Second Order Derivatives\nThe solution to our problem is to find the derivative of the derivative! Until now, we've found the derivative of a function, and indicated it as ***f'(x)***. Technically, this is known as the *prime* derivative; and it describes the slope of the function. Since the derivative function is itself a function, we can find its derivative, which we call the *second order* (or sometimes just *second*) derivative. This is indicated like this: ***f''(x)***.\n\nSo, here's our function for the kicked football:\n\n\\begin{equation}k(x) = -10x^{2} + 100x + 3 \\end{equation}\n\nHere's the function for the prime derivative:\n\n\\begin{equation}k'(x) = -20x + 100 \\end{equation}\n\nAnd using a combination of the power rule and the constant rule, here's the function for the second derivative:\n\n\\begin{equation}k''(x) = -20 \\end{equation}\n\nNow, without even drawing the graph, we can see that the second derivative has a constant value; so we know that the slope of the prime derivative is linear; and because it's a negative value, we know that it is decreasing. So when the prime derivative crosses 0, it we know that the slope of the function is decreasing linearly; so the point at *x=0* must be a maximum point.\n\nRun the following code to plot the function, the prime derivative, and the second derivative for the kicked ball:"

      "source": "## Optimization\nThe ability to use derivatives to find minima and maxima of a function makes it a useful tool for scenarios where you need to optimize a function for a specific variable.\n\n### Defining Functions to be Optimized\nFor example, suppose you have decided to build an online video service that is based on a subscription model. You plan to charge a monthly subscription fee, and you want to make the most revenue possible. The problem is that customers are price-sensitive, so if you set the monthly fee too high, you'll deter some customers from signing up. Conversely, if you set the fee too low, you may get more customers, but at the cost of reduced revenue.\n\nWhat you need is some kind of function that will tell you how many subscriptions you might expect to get based on a given fee. So you've done some research, and found a formula to indicate that the expected subscription volume (in thousands) can be calculated as 5-times the monthly fee subtracted from 100; or expressed as a function:\n\n\\begin{equation}s(x) = -5x + 100\\end{equation}\n\nWhat you actually want to optimize is monthly revenue, which is simply the number of subscribers multiplied by the fee:\n\n\\begin{equation}r(x) = s(x) \\cdot x\\end{equation}\n\nWe can combine ***s(x)*** into ***r(x)*** like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}r(x) = -5x^{2} + 100x\\end{equation}\n\n### Finding the Prime Derivative\nThe function ***r(x)*** will return the expected monthly revenue (in thousands) for any proposed fee (*x*). What we need to do now is to find the fee that yields the maximum revenue. Fortunately, we can use a derivative to do that.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the prime derivative of ***r(x)***, and we can do that easily using the power rule:\n\n\\begin{equation}r'(x) = 2 \\cdot -5x + 100\\end{equation}\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\begin{equation}r'(x) = -10x + 100\\end{equation}\n\n### Find Critical Points\nNow we need to find any critical points where the derivative is 0, as this could indicate a maximum:\n\n\\begin{equation}-10x + 100 = 0\\end{equation}\n\nLet's isolate the *x* term:\n\n\\begin{equation}-10x = -100\\end{equation}\n\nBoth sides are negative, so we can mulitply both by -1 to make them positive without affecting the equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}10x = 100\\end{equation}\n\nNow we can divide both sides by 10 to isolate *x*:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{100}{10}\\end{equation}\n\nSo:\n\n\\begin{equation}x = 10\\end{equation}\n\n#### Check for a Maximum\nWe now know that with an *x* value of of **10**, the derivative is 0; or put another way, when the fee is 10, the slope indicating the change in subscription volume is flat. This could potentially be a point where the change in subscription volume has peaked (in other words, a maximum); but it could also be a minimum or just an inflexion point where the rate of change transitions from negative to positive.\n\nTo be sure, we can check the second order derivative. We can calculate this by applying the power rule to the prime derivative:\n\n\\begin{equation}r''(x) = -10\\end{equation}\n\nNote that the second derivative is a constant with a negative value. It will be the same for any point, including our critical point at *x=10*:\n\n\\begin{equation}r''(10) = -10\\end{equation}\n\nA negative value for the second derivative tells us that the derivative slope is moving in a negative direction at the point where it is 0, so the function value must be at a maximum.\n\nIn other words, the optimal monthly fee for our online video service is 10 - this will generate the maximum monthly revenue.\n\nRun the code below to show the function ***r(x)*** as a graph, and verify that the maximum point is at x = 10."
